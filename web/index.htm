		<p>Just a computer geek wanting to talk about his journey in jiu jitsu.  I created this blog just to help in my growth in the art, but also the assist the people just starting out in the jiu jitsu, through my own mistakes and experience. I’m technically  not a white belt anymore but I truly believe we are still white belts even though our belt colors change.  I’m still learning the ins and outs of it.  There is a vast amount to learn and it’s nearly impossible to learn everything.  I believe that’s the fun part of jiu jitsu.  Reading this hopefully this help you out too.

		<h3 align = "center">Perspective</h1>
		<p>What I found in jiu jitsu is the different perspective of each person and belt levels.  Myself even what I use to think when I first started out is different from what I see now. A person that is a black belt his perspective is different from when he was a brown belt.  It’s interesting to see how we evolve in our journey.  What I learned on the first day of class, I would go back to and refine that skill and think to myself, “Why didn’t I see that before.”  Simple hip escape for example has so much detail in how it being use.  We think to ourselves “it just moving your hips,” but it’s not just that. Do you exaggerate the  hip movement? Do you hip out inch by inch?  Ask a blue belt about it and it would be different from what  a black belt would say about it. I think that’s the most important thing is always asking questions.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h3 align="center">Knowledge</h1>
		<p>Everytime I train on the mats, there is always something I learn or refine.  Imagine yourself in a cave.  When you first walk in you can’t see anything except for darkness. This is how I felt on my first day of Jiu Jitsu.  I didn’t know anything.  Now imagine if you had a candle in the cave.  The brighter the flame the more we realize how big this cave is. I see the flame as the knowledge we gain throughout our journey. Each technique, escape, submission that I learn represents the illumination of the candle, but we realize how much more there is to learn.
